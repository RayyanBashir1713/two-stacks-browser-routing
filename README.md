A lightweight C++ console application that simulates browser navigation using two stacks: a Back Stack and a Forward Stack. This project demonstrates how modern browsers manage page history through stack-based operations.
#Overview
This system allows users to:
Visit new pages
Navigate Back and Forward
View the current active page
Inspect Back and Forward history
It closely mirrors real browser navigation logic using stack data structures.
